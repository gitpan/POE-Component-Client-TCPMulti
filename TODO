- Sometimes TMtimeout is being called after a connection errors, this means
  that errors aren't always deleting the timeout alarm.   This behavior has
  been bypassed by error checking to ensure events are only processed if they
  are valid, but this behavior should be fixed since it causes extra events
  to be called, and our current focus is supposedly on EFFICIENCY, so thats
  bad :)
