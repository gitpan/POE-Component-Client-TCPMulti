SO MUCH HAS CHANGED, I already wrote this commit up and somehow it was lost.

pocoscan.pl was moved to examples tree which may contain more in future.
Makefile.PL has been broken in an attempt to separate documentation
    it still works the documentation just isn't installed.

Rewrote documentation in otl.  it is now much more clear and concise and
covers alot more detail about the workings of the module rather than
simply marketing the module.  The last few sections still need some work.

Separated socket creation into a package method called connect
    The connect method allows you to set various options on the specific
    connection being created past what the inline state previously allowed.
    The connect method allows you to:
        - Prepropigate the connection heap before the connection attempt
        - Set InputTimeout and ConnectTimeout for that particular connection
        - Bypass using the POE event loop to create a connection -
            * I wouldn't use this for creating thousands of connections at once
    The connect method is used by the inline state, so code is not dupliacted.

Globalized heap which opens the door for a portable connection heap accessor.
    Didn't break multiple sessions!  Wheel id's are generated on a per kernel
    rather than per session basis.

TODO: Fix 'make documentation', fix pod installation.
TODO: Fix InputTimeout option of CHEAP->connect.

Added portscan.pl, a cleaner, better written proof of concept.

Added some error checking on inline states (reporting line/file of
caller).        

Moved UserCode processes to begining and fixed a bug in the FilterArgs
constructor option (it was always being overriden :-/)

Fixed a bug with user _stop, where I had _end stuck everywhere for some
stupid reason (its _stop, not _end!) I even had _end in the documentation
(updated that)...

Fixed bug in Success State, as assigning $_[ARG4] over $_[CHEAP] because $#_ had just been incremented, and $_[CHEAP] was in the $_[ARG4] position.

Fixed up pocoscan.pl a little and gave it a nice little verbose output.

r257 | (no author) | 2003-08-13 17:30:50 -0700 (Wed, 13 Aug 2003) | 3 lines

Added pocoscan.pl, proof of concept and proof of working code.  Its probably not the best example to provide since it is in fact a proxy scanner, but whatever it execercises all features of the module and works perfectly, maintains a specific number of concurrent connections, and is indefinately more efficient than the ::Client::TCP version of the same code [ I suppose I should add that, I will after cleaning it up a little ].  With ::Client::TCP I could run about 50 concurrent connections without crashing my laptop...with ::Client::TCPMulti I can run about 450...wee!

Tons of bug fixes!

TONS!

Fixed almost everything, although some parts of the code are relying on error checking in order to work properly, this is inappropriate.  Will be fixed soon.  I actually think that some of the problems that have extra error checking have in fact been fixed but I'm not yet comfortable with removing the error checking.
