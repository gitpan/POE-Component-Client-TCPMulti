rev 22:  (no author) | 2003-08-13 22:55:44 -0700 (Wed, 13 Aug 2003) | 4 lines

Fixed bug in Success State, as assigning $_[ARG4] over $_[CHEAP] because $#_ had just been incremented, and $_[CHEAP] was in the $_[ARG4] position.

Fixed up pocoscan.pl a little and gave it a nice little verbose output.

rev 18:  (no author) | 2003-08-13 17:30:50 -0700 (Wed, 13 Aug 2003) | 3 lines

Added pocoscan.pl, proof of concept and proof of working code.  Its probably not the best example to provide since it is in fact a proxy scanner, but whatever it execercises all features of the module and works perfectly, maintains a specific number of concurrent connections, and is indefinately more efficient than the ::Client::TCP version of the same code [ I suppose I should add that, I will after cleaning it up a little ].  With ::Client::TCP I could run about 50 concurrent connections without crashing my laptop...with ::Client::TCPMulti I can run about 450...wee!

Tons of bug fixes!

TONS!

Fixed almost everything, although some parts of the code are relying on error checking in order to work properly, this is inappropriate.  Will be fixed soon.  I actually think that some of the problems that have extra error checking have in fact been fixed but I'm not yet comfortable with removing the error checking.
